    <h3>Inspired by: Chick-Fil-A Chick-n-Strips</h3>

    <p>I recently made this recipe of Mom's for my in-laws and they told me it was the "best fried chicken ever."</p>
    <p>Slicing the chicken breasts into strips cuts down on cooking time and ensures every piece is crunchy and evenly coated.</p>
    <p>Serve the homemade chicken tenders with your favorite dipping sauce.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>2-2/3 cups crushed saltines (about 80 crackers)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, combine the first 5 ingredients. In another shallow bowl, beat egg and milk. Dip chicken into egg mixture, then cracker mixture.</li>
        <li>In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375Â°. Fry chicken, a few strips at a time, for 2-3 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
